# Lesson 2: Variables

Let’s keep learning some R skills! These examples are a bit trickier than the ones you just saw.

As coders, people need to store the results of a calculation so they can refer to it later. For example, you might want your computer to remember pi for you.

Try running the code below:

<iframe data-type="datacamp" id="variables-1" height="350" src="https://uclatall.github.io/mtucker-coding-study/data-camp/dc-variables-1.html" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" width="100%"></iframe>

Remember how we said `=` is used to create variables? That's what just happened: we made up a name for our variable and assigned a value to it.

Create a variable named `fav_num` and assign it to your favorite number.

<iframe data-type="datacamp" id="variables-2" height="350" src="https://uclatall.github.io/mtucker-coding-study/data-camp/dc-variables-2.html" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" width="100%"></iframe>

Awesome! But variables seem pretty boring by themselves. What's the point? One thing we could try is using our variables in a calculation.

What happens when you type `fav_num + 1`?

<iframe data-type="datacamp" id="variables-3" height="350" src="https://uclatall.github.io/mtucker-coding-study/data-camp/dc-variables-3.html" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" width="100%"></iframe>


Interesting. What happens when you create `fav_num` again, with a different number than what you had before? My favorite number is 7.

Try creating `fav_num` with the number `7`.

<iframe data-type="datacamp" id="variables-4" height="350" src="https://uclatall.github.io/mtucker-coding-study/data-camp/dc-variables-4.html" style="border: 0px #ffffff none;" width="100%"></iframe>

Coders call this variable reassignment. Variables are containers: we can put stuff in them. When we reassigned the variable, we just took out the number that was already in the container and replaced it with something else. That's why it's called a variable: we are able to vary (change) it.
